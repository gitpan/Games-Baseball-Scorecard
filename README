This is Games::Baseball::Scorecard, for generating baseball scorecards,
and optionally filling out the lineups and even scoring a complete game.


You must have mpost, mptopdf, and pdftex installed to fully use this module.

I don't really know much about Metapost or TeX, so don't ask me.  However, I can
say that I installed TeX on Mac OS X (10.3 Server and 10.4) using the i-Installer.

I just installed the basic TeX install.  All seems happy.


See example.plx and example.pdf for ... examples.
